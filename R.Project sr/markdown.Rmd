## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
auto <- read.table("https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/test.txt", header=FALSE)
head(auto[,2:3])
```

```{r}
potato <- read.delim("~/rstudio-2022.07.1+554/bin/potatoes.txt",sep="\t", header=F,
                     col.names = c("M","Y","Z","A","B", "T", "U", "P", "yy"))
head(potato[,7:9])
